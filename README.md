# C.O.D Clone

## A simply vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS project. 

The Story: I'm trying to get better at Front-End(FE) technologies like css and html. Useful within many FE technologies but you should probably  know the basics too. One day I was playing Call of Duty and was admiring the start menu. 4-5 panels with a list of options. When one panel is hovered it takes up slightly more width than the others. I thought to myself. Although I'm a beginner when it comes to FE stuff, I could make this with vanilla stack. So here you go.
